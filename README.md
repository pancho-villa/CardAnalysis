# CardAnalysis

A simple card game with some built in AI to run simulations of various strategies. Currently it only supports [skat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-one_%28card_game%29) (aka blitz 31)

# example

Unix based systems
```
/usr/bin/env python3 skat.py
```

Windows
```
path to python3.exe skat.py
```
# future goals

Add AI to use bayesian inference to decide on best moves to make. Also want to add a human like shuffle module as random.shuffle is too 'perfect'. If you want efficient winning strategies you need to simulate real life conditions.
